For insertion sort the reverse sorted array plot grew parabolically at a rate of n^2; as the size of the array increased the execution time increased. For insertion sort the sorted array plot was linear; the execution time stayed the same even as the array size grew because the program didn\'92t make any swaps, it just looked through the array and found that it was already sorted. For merge sort the sorted and reverse sorted arrays grew at the same rate of about nlogn, since the program makes the same number of comparisons to check whether it is sorted or not. For selection sort the graphs are both parabolic but the reverse sorted array required more swaps than the sorted array, so the reverse sorted array had higher execution times. }
